## Julien Charvet

Hi! I'm Julien Charvet, a computer science engineering student at [Enseirb-Matmeca](https://enseirb-matmeca.bordeaux-inp.fr/fr). I do a lot of different things, but I especially like gamedev and robotics. 

Ranging from gameplay programming to 3D modelling and animation, I've touched to a lot of different subjects related to game development. 
With a solid 7+ years foundation on the Unity game engine as a hobbyist, I am currently working on two projects:
- a souls-like game taking place in a classic fantasy world I started creating back in 2015,
- and a simple multiplayer deathmatch/brawl game to consolidate my Unreal Engine skills.  

Although programming is fun, sometimes you need a break. And if you ever go climbing, hiking, writing or even do theatre, count me in! 


### Current situation

Reaching the end of my engineering studies, I'm looking for a 6 months internship in gamedev.
